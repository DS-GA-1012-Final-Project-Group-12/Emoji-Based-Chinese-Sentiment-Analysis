# Emoji-Based-Chinese-Sentiment-Analysis

Emoji is a valuable source of subtext that skews the interpretation of a sentence in a particular direction. In this project, we studied the expressiveness of emojis for sentiment analysis through fine-tuning a RoBERTa model on Weibo reviews and evaluating its performance. Moreover, we investigated the expected performance boost in a binary sentiment analysis task that can be attained with the inclusion of emojis. Our results showed that the description of emojis captures the sentiment of short texts well, and thus should be treated with a same level of importance as words for sentiment analysis.
